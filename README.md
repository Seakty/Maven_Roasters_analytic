## 📊 Analysis & Key Findings

The analysis of the sales data revealed several key insights into the business's performance and customer behavior:

* **Strong Growth Trajectory:** The business demonstrated remarkable growth, with daily revenue **more than doubling** over the six-month period.
* **Weekday & Morning Peaks:** Sales are heavily concentrated during the **weekday morning rush (8-11 AM)**, indicating a primary customer base of commuters and professionals.
* **Weekend Performance Gap:** A significant opportunity was identified on weekends, with **Saturday being the lowest-performing day**, suggesting an untapped market of local residents and families.
* **Product Performance:** A small group of core products (e.g., Barista Espresso, Brewed Chai Tea) drive the majority of revenue. The analysis also highlighted "high-value" products that earn the most revenue despite not being the highest in quantity sold.

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

Based on the data-driven findings, the following strategic recommendations were proposed to drive further growth:

1.  **Capture the Weekend Market:** Launch targeted marketing campaigns and weekend-specific promotions (e.g., "Saturday Specials") to attract a local audience and close the Saturday sales gap.
2.  **Optimize the Morning Rush:** Reinforce staffing and streamline operations during the 8-11 AM peak to maximize throughput and revenue.
3.  **Refine the Menu Offering:** Leverage data to prominently feature high-value, high-revenue products. Consider re-evaluating or removing the lowest-performing items to simplify operations and reduce waste.
